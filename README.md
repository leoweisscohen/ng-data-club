Nottingham Psychology data club resources

Some materials for the lunchtime (?) *data club*, an informal weekly meeting at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/).

## Aim

>Bring people with varied backgrounds together to talk about, unpack, learn about quantitative methods for 

- organising
- analysing 
- visualising 

data.

## Ideas for meetings / wishlist?

Whatever people want to talk about first... or to start things off, one topic from the list below.

Could structure things according to

1. *I want answer the following question with my data... How do I do that?* and/or
2. *I know the following technique, which could help you with bla...*

In no particular order (for now)

- PCA, ICA, related methods
- linear regression, basics of linear algebra?
- "dimensionality reduction"
- t-SNE
- basic ideas behind solving inverse problems
- how do people organise data, meta-data
- "Tidy Data" / tidyverse and related ideas (in `r`), Pandas (`python`), Tables (`matlab`). Long and wide data? `select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `summarise` (`dplyr`/`sql` syntax) 

## Links to tools

## Notes / slides

- could have 1 markdown/readme file per session with code snippets, links (3brown1blue, MIT OCW, Khan Academy, ...), papers, 

## Colophon
