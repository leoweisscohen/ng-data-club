## Code of conduct

We have a [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) that applies to our meetings, emails, MS Teams, github discussion forum and other interactions. Please have a look at it.

## Ideas for meetings / wishlist

We will try to keep meetings informal with some guided discussion by presenters that will change week by week.

Structure will be around:

1. *I want answer the following question with my data... How do I do that?* and/or
2. *I know the following technique, which could help you with bla...*
