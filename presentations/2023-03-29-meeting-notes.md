## Data visualisation

2023-03-29

Denis Schluppeck

In this session we launch the next block of presentations + meetings in which we want to discuss ways of visualising data, what people in different labs use, what works well, what people need help with, etc.

- [the presentation slides](./2023-03-29-data-visualisation/2023-03-29-datavis-presentation.html) for my intro talk, made in `quarto`
- or if you prefer the [html notes version](./2023-03-29-data-visualisation/2023-03-29-datavis-notes.html)

You can check out the [github repo](https://github.com/schluppeck/ng-data-club) for the `qmd` source files.
