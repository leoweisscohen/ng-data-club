## Motivation

::: {.incremental}
- often useful to produce short documents that mix code snippets, plots, text, images

- could use PPT, Keynote, Word (but don't play nicely with version control)

- use a simple text based version
:::

## Where would you use this?

::: {.incremental}
- teaching (content changes slightly/a lot) each year
- research: publishing data + code is now a *must* for many journals
- after this walk-through, it would be great to discuss if people find this useful?! What for?
:::

## `markdown` is widely used 

- if you want some *light markup* 
- go **beyond simple text** 
- a couple of ~~key things~~ like 
- [easy to write links](www.google.com)

## ... images

## Maths, equations are easy

$$\chi^2 = \sum_i \Big( \frac{y_i-y(x_i; a_1\dots, a_M )}{\sigma_i} \Big)^2 $$

## Challenges

- placing images where you want them (arbitrarily on page) requires some work

- you need to render / transform it (only seconds, but not instantaneous)

- if you make mistakes you  (it's a very light version of coding)

- if you link to local files (images, etc), you have to remember to move them along (not a problem if everything is online)


## Advantages

- markdown (itself) structures your documents

- can easily be **tranformed** into `pdf`, `pptx`, `docx`, `revealjs`, etc.

- gets rendered nicely on `github.com`, by defauilt

- easy to edit, rules are simple to learn

::: {.fragment}
- you can add in `computations` code in `r`, `python`, `julia` et al and make them part of your documents $\rightarrow$ `quarto`
:::

## quick demo

- `VSCode` with markdown plugin (linting, preview)
- (! the `github.com` repo which gets rendered using a tool called `jekyll` under the hood)


## `quarto`

- a command line tool that renders a flavour of markdown called `qmd` (quarto-markdow)

- a superset of markdown, so any previous work should be ok

- by adding some additional info at top of document, you can opt into lots of good stuff

## info at top: `YAML`

A text block delimited by `---`, key/value

```yaml

## `quarto`


- if you like `RStudio`, there is a nice interface

- `VScode` has a plugin that works well

- or if you prefer `emacs/vim/nano/TextEdit`, the command line tool is not that hard to use.

```bash
quarto preview test.qmd 
# or render
quarto render test.qmd --to pdf
```
